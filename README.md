# Snakes and Ladders

## Description
A classic snakes-and-ladders game for 2-4 players (local, hot seat). <br>
The game can be played, but the code needs to be refactored and made scalable [PENDING].

### TO-DO:
* Go through feedback (GameSettings, Route)
* Fix random level generation
* Instantiate the playing field (nodes)
* Enumerator for player type
* Allow for piece selection (ensure at least two players are in the game)
* Add background music, rolling-the-dice sound, piece-moving sound, win sound, button-click sound, going-up/down sound
* Implement state machine for gameflow control
